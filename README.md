Projects

[(https://github.com/xreddr/xreddr/blob/main/images/cd_banner.png)](https://github.com/xreddr/crawl_dir)
Please check out [crawl_dir](https://github.com/xreddr/crawl_dir). A CLI CRUD application written in native python that records and compares timestamped directory contents.

Look further and you will find:
- blackjack/ A simple game of blackjack. This is not complete.
- dice/ A simple dice game, probably at some point of working expansion. 
- gitScore/ A file counting project.
- xreddr.github.io/ A basic web-site that is in a working stage, somewhat of a mess depending on when you check.
