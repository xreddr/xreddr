[GameBrah](https://github.com/xreddr/GameBrah) is a passion project of mine. It's a retro style game controller for touch screens designed for phones. This is a spare time project that makes slow progress but I would love to discuss it.  
  

Look further and you will find:
- blackjack/ A simple game of blackjack. This is not complete.
- dice/ A simple dice game, probably at some point of working expansion. 
- gitScore/ A file counting project.
- xreddr.github.io/ A basic web-site that is in a working stage, somewhat of a mess depending on when you check.
