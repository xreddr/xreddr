Welcome
=======

I like to clickity clack on my laptop and IDE's make text really colorful so I started writing more.
The code eventually did something, which was cool, so I started learning more:
- HTML
- CSS

Now that I could create spaces and objects I wanted to interact with and manipulate them so I started learning:
- SASS
- PY

Python is a step in a different dirrection but I would like to apply what I've learned to:
- JS
- SQL

The work is getting more expansive and so to direct my work and track progress I downloaded:
- Git

"Hello World!"

Projects
--------

Look further and you will find:
- crawlDir/ A self-taught project using file handling, collection sorting, and user inputs.
- gitScore/ A file counting project.
- xreddr.github.io/ A basic web-site that is in a working stage, somewhat of a mess depending on when you check.
